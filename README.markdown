#Widget_table_for - ActiveAdmin

This is a widget table for active admin. It allows you to have very similar functionality to index page tables. Multiple widget tables can be created on a single page each with their own pagination and sorting.

Pagination, and sorting work correctly, along with `default_actions` as normal.

There are no filter panels or scopes yet.

This also needs some tests eventually

This is also a work in progress, I haven't really done much refactoring since getting everything working right, I'm sure some cleanup and organization is in order.
