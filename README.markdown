#Widget_table_for - ActiveAdmin

This is a widget table for active admin. It allows you to have very similar functionality to index page tables.

Pagination, and sorting work correctly, along with default actions as normal.

There are no filter panels or scopes yet.

This also needs some tests eventually

This is also a work in progress, I haven't really done much refactoring since getting everything working right, I'm sure some cleanup and organization is in order.
